These are:\n(a) localized form:\n - cutaneous: skin lesion evolving over 1 to 6 days from a papular through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar invariably accompanied by edema that may be mild to extensive\n - systemic forms:\n - gastro-intestinal: abdominal distress characterized by nausea, vomiting, anorexia and followed by fever\n - pulmonary (inhalation): brief prodrome resembling acute viral respiratory illness, followed by rapid onset of hypoxia, dyspnea and high temperature, with X-ray evidence of mediastinal widening \n - meningeal: acute onset of high fever possibly with convulsions, loss of consciousness, meningeal signs and symptoms; commonly noted in all systemic infections\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis\n - isolation of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> from a clinical specimen (e.g., blood, lesions, discharges)\n - demonstration of <i>B. anthracis</i> in a clinical specimen by microscopic examination of stained smears (vesicular fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, stools)\n - positive serology (ELISA, Western blot, toxin detection, chromatographic assay, fluorescent antibody test (FAT)\n - Note: It may not be possible to demonstrate B. anthracis in clinical specimens if the patient has been treated with antimicrobial agents.\nCase classification\n - Suspected: A case that is compatible with the clinical description and has an epidemiological link to confirmed or suspected animal cases or contaminated animal products.\n - Probable: A suspected case that has a positive reaction to allergic skin test (in non-vaccinated individuals).\nConfirmed: A suspected case that is laboratory-confirmed.\n\n<b>Cutaneous anthrax:</b>\n - 95% of anthrax cases (worldwide) are cutaneous. \n - The incubation period for cutaneous anthrax ranges from 12 hours to 12 days. \n - Cutaneous anthrax begins with pruritus at the affected site, typically followed by a small, painless papule that progresses to a vesicle in 1 to 2 days. <gdn-pref id='15207306'></gdn-pref> \n - The lesion erodes, leaving a necrotic ulcer with a characteristic black center. \n - Secondary vesicles are sometimes observed.  \n - Lymphadenopathy may occur, and local edema may be extensive. \n - Patients may have fever, malaise, and headache. \n - The most common sites of cutaneous anthrax are the hands, forearms, and head.  \n - Anthrax related to illicit drug injection may present as subcutaneous infection rather than overt skin lesions. <gdn-pref id='21357967'></gdn-pref>\n - Rarely infection may involve the genital area <gdn-pref id='18053349'></gdn-pref> , eyelids <gdn-pref id='19378894'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='19927487'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='20689787'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='24009441'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='24641116'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='27551179'></gdn-pref> , lips <gdn-pref id='24120906'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='22393634'></gdn-pref> or other sites.\n - Cutaneous anthrax is fatal in approximately 20% of cases if left untreated.\n\n<b>Inhalational anthrax:</b> <gdn-pref id='12015917'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='12746773'></gdn-pref>\n - Infection may progress to respiratory failure and shock within 1 to 2 days following onset of symptoms.\n - The case-fatality rate exceeds 80%, even with appropriate antibiotic therapy. <gdn-pref id='10559102'></gdn-pref>  \n - Symptoms include pharyngeal pain, cough, fever and myalgia - followed by respiratory distress, cervical edema and venous engorgement suggestive of mediastintis. <gdn-pref id='11930529'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='11353060'></gdn-pref>\n\n<b>Gastrointestinal anthrax: <gdn-pref id='12095428'></gdn-pref></b>\n - Infection is characterized by pharyngeal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. <gdn-pref id='24009958'></gdn-pref>\n - Intestinal gangrene, obstruction and perforation may ensue. <gdn-pref id='14609791'></gdn-pref>  \n - The case-fatality rate for intestinal infection ranges from 25% to 60%.  \n - Ulcerative lesions, usually multiple and superficial, may occur in the stomach, sometimes in association with similar lesions of the esophagus and jejunum. \n - Ulcers may bleed, and in severe cases the hemorrhage may be massive and fatal.  \n - Ascites may be present. \n - Lesions in the mid-jejunum, terminal ileum, or cecum tend to develop around a single site or a few sites of ulceration and edema, similar to cutaneous anthrax.\n\n<b>Oropharyngeal anthrax:</b>\n - Infection is characterized by painful neck swelling and fever. \n - The other common symptoms are sore throat, dysphagia, and hoarseness, enlargement of cervical lymph nodes and soft tissue edema.  \n - Oral lesions are located on the tonsils, posterior pharyngeal wall, or the hard palate. <gdn-pref id='19499256'></gdn-pref>\n - In severe cases, the tonsillar lesions extended to involve the anterior and posterior pillars of fauces, as well as the soft palate and uvula.  \n - Early lesions are edematous and congested. \n - By the end of the first week, central necrosis and ulceration produce a whitish patch, which evolves to a pseudomembrane which covers the ulcer after an additional week.\n\n<b>Meningeal anthrax:</b> <gdn-pref id='15854884'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='27025833'></gdn-pref>\n - Infection is characterized by fever, malaise, meningeal signs, hyperreflexia, and delirium, stupor, or coma. <gdn-pref id='11874170'></gdn-pref>  \n - CSF analyses demonstrated hemorrhagic meningitis, with positive Gram's stains and CSF cultures. \n - 75% of patients die within 24 hours of presentation;

In the environment , sporulation occurs after days or weeks at temperatures between 22°C to 32°C, resulting in division of the sporont into two sporocysts, each containing two elongate sporozoites .  Fresh produce and water can serve as vehicles for transmission  and the sporulated oocysts are ingested (in contaminated food or water) .  The oocysts excyst in the gastrointestinal tract, freeing the sporozoites which invade the epithelial cells of the small intestine .  Inside the cells they undergo asexual multiplication and sexual development to mature into oocysts, which will be shed in stools .  The potential mechanisms of contamination of food and water are still under investigation.\r\n\r\n",

A variable proportion of adult infections are asymptomatic.\n - Acute illness typically including acute jaundice, dark urine, anorexia, malaise, extreme fatigue, and right upper quadrant tenderness. \n - Biological signs include increased urine urobilinogen and >2.5 times the upper limit of serum alanine aminotransferase.\n<b>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis</b>\n - Hepatitis A: IgM anti-HAV positive\n - Hepatitis B: positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or IgM anti-HBC-positive\n - Non-A, non-B: IgM anti-HAV and IgM anti-HBc (or HBsAg) negative\nNote 1: The anti-HBc IgM test, specific for acute infection, is not available in most countries. \n - HBsAg, often available, cannot distinguish between acute new infections and exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B, although continued HBsAg seropositivity (>6 months) is an indicator of chronic infection.\nNote 2: For patients negative for hepatitis A or B, further testing for a diagnosis of acute hepatitis C, D, or E is recommended:\n - Hepatitis C: anti-HCV positive\n - Hepatitis D: HBsAg positive or IgM anti-HBc positive plus anti-HDV positive (only as co-infection or super-infection of hepatitis B)\n - Hepatitis E: IgM anti-HEV positive\n<b>Case classification</b>\n<i>Suspected</i> A case that is compatible with the clinical description.\n<i>Probable</i> Not applicable.\n<i>Confirmed</i> A suspected case that is laboratory confirmed or, for hepatitis A only, a case compatible with the clinical description, in a person who has an epidemiological link with a laboratory-confirmed case of hepatitis A (i.e. household or sexual contact with an infected person during the 15-50 days before the onset of symptoms).\n\n<b>Clinical features of Hepatitis E:</b>\nIn contrast to hepatitis A, hepatitis E is characterized by:\n -

                    "description": "The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts.  During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host .  Sporozoites infect liver cells  and mature into schizonts , which rupture and release merozoites .  (Of note, in P. vivax and P. ovale a dormant stage [hypnozoites] can persist in the liver and cause relapses by invading the bloodstream weeks, or even years later.)  After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony ), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony ).  Merozoites infect red blood cells .  The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing merozoites .  Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) .  Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. \r\n\r\nThe gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal .  The parasites’ multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle .  While in the mosquito\\'s stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes .  The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes)  which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts .  The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites , which make their way to the mosquito\\'s salivary glands.  Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle . \r\n\r\n",

The case definition for malaria cannot be uniform: it will vary according to how malaria is perceived in a given country, local patterns of transmission, and disease consequences. \n - The suggested definitions are deliberately broad. \n - Each national malaria control program must adapt the definition and introduce additional indicators to make it more applicable to local epidemiology and control targets.\nClinical description\n - Signs and symptoms vary; most patients experience fever.\n - Splenomegaly and anemia are commonly associated signs.\n - Common but non-specific symptoms include otherwise unexplained headache, back pain, chills, sweating, myalgia, nausea, vomiting.\n - Untreated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> infection can lead to coma, generalized convulsions, hyperparasitemia, normocytic anemia, disturbances of fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyperpyrexia, hemoglobinuria, circulatory collapse / shock, spontaneous bleeding (disseminated intravascular coagulation), pulmonary edema, and death.\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis\n - Demonstration of malaria parasites in blood films (mainly asexual forms).\n \n<b>Case classification</b>\nIn areas without access to laboratory-based diagnosis.\n - Probable uncomplicated malaria: A person with symptoms and/or signs of malaria who receives anti-malarial treatment.\n - Probable severe malaria: A patient who requires hospitalization for symptoms and signs of severe malaria and receives anti-malarial treatment.\n - Probable malaria death: death of a patient diagnosed with probable severe malaria.\nIn areas with access to laboratory-based diagnosis.\n - Asymptomatic malaria: A person with no recent history of symptoms and/or signs of malaria who shows laboratory confirmation of parasitemia.\n - Confirmed uncomplicated malaria: A patient with symptoms and/or signs of malaria who received anti-malarial treatment, with laboratory confirmation of diagnosis.\n\n<b>Clinical presentation</b>\nMost cases present with non-specific signs suggestive of \"sepsis,\" such as fever, rigors, headache and myalgia.  \n - Clinical findings include cough, fatigue, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and  diaphoresis.  \n - The typical malarial paroxysm begins with rigors lasting 1 to 2 hours, followed by high fever.  \n - This is followed by marked diaphoresis and a fall in temperature.  \n - Tertian (fever every other day) fever may occur in infection by <i>P. falciparum</i>, <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i>; quartan (every third day) fever with <i>P. malariae</i> infection; and daily fever with <i>P. knowlesi</i> infection. <gdn-pref id='18678527'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='21795115'></gdn-pref>\n -

Most lesions are in the distal colon.\n\n<b>Dysentery</b>\nDysentery may be simply defined as diarrhea containing blood. \n - Although several organisms can cause dysentery, <i>Shigella</i> are the most important. <i>Shigella dysenteriae</i> type 1 (Sd1) [the Shiga bacillus], is the most virulent of the four serogroups of <i>Shigella</i>.\n - Sd1 is the only cause of epidemic dysentery. In addition to bloody diarrhea, \n - Sd1 infection is often associated with abdominal cramps, fever and proctalgia. \n - Less frequent complications include sepsis, seizures, renal failure and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. <gdn-pref id='23082627'></gdn-pref> \n - Approximately 5-15% of Sd1 cases are fatal.\n\n<b>Complications</b>\nPatients with mild disease generally recover without specific therapy in two to seven days. \n - Severe shigellosis can progress to toxic dilatation or perforation of the colon, which may be fatal.  \n - Mild dehydration is common, and protein-losing enteropathy can occur with severe disease.   \n - Complications are most commonly described in developing countries and are related both to the relative prevalence of <i>S. dysenteriae</i> type 1 and <i>S. flexneri</i>, and the poor nutritional state of the local populations.  \n - <i>Shigella</i> bacteremia is not uncommon, and is associated with increased mortality, particularly among infants below one year of age and persons with protein-energy malnutrition. <gdn-pref id='17366038'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='12862343'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='8208644'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='3277577'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='3314766'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='25920737'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='28658760'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='31855540'></gdn-pref>\n - Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) may complicate shigellosis due to <i>S. dysenteriae</i> type 1, and usually develops toward the end of the first week of shigellosis. <gdn-pref id='2246628'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='8591635'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='23082627'></gdn-pref>  The case-fatality rate in these cases is 36%. <gdn-pref id='22579556'></gdn-pref>  HUS due to other <i>Shigella sonnei</i> has also been reported. <gdn-pref id='28239557'></gdn-pref>\n - Profound hyponatremia and hypoglycemia may occur.  \n - Reactive arthritis follows 7% to 10% of <i>Shigella</i> infections. <gdn-pref id='15550534'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='18203313'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='10063518'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='22832290'></gdn-pref> It occurs in patients having histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27. <gdn-pref id='400766'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='6948959'></gdn-pref>\n - Early childhood shigellosis appears to be associated with an increased rate of long-term Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. <gdn-pref id='32698643'></gdn-pref>\n\nOther complications include: \n - Altered consciousness \n - Bizarre posturing\n - Encephalopathy <gdn-pref id='20016394'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='29351935'></gdn-pref> \n - Keratoconjunctivitis <gdn-pref id='16757643'></gdn-pref>\n - Meningitis\n - Pneumonia <gdn-pref id='19891897'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='27909896'></gdn-pref> \n - \"Rose spots\" \n - Seizures\n - Vaginitis",

Symptoms are often nonspecific and insidious in onset. <gdn-pref id='12864957'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='12456854'></gdn-pref>  \n - Following an incubation period of 5 to 21 days, an initial enterocolitis may develop without associated fever.  \n - Constipation is present in 10 to 40% of patients; abdominal pain 20 to 40%; hepatosplenomegaly in 50%.  \n - Such symptoms as chills, diaphoresis, headache, anorexia, cough, sore throat, vertigo and myalgia often precede the onset of fever.  \n - Psychosis or confusion (\"muttering delirium\") occur in 5 to 10%, encephalopathy in 21% <gdn-pref id='22492156'></gdn-pref> , and seizures and coma in less than 1%.\n - Patients appear acutely ill. \n -

Cough is also common. \n - Defervescence within 48 hours following tetracycline therapy strongly suggests a rickettsial etiology.\n - Eschar may be absent in some geographic areas and in highly endemic areas where reinfection is frequent.\n - Persons of Japanese or Caucasian ancestry are more likely to develop a rash than are those of other ethnic groups. <gdn-pref id='22492134'></gdn-pref>\n - Rash may be overlooked in patients with dark or sunburned skin.\n\n<b>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis</b>\n - Isolation of <i>Orientia tsutsugamushi</i> by inoculation of patient blood in white mice (preferably treated with cyclophosphamide at 0.2 mg/g intraperitoneally or intramuscularly on days 1,2 and 4 after inoculation).\n - Serology: Detection of specific IgM at 1:100 or higher by Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) or 1:32 dilution or higher by Immunoperoxidase (IP) or 1:10 dilution or higher by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IF).\n\n<b>Case classification</b>\n<i>Suspected:</i> A case that is compatible with the clinical description.\n<i>Confirmed:</i> A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.\nNote: Serological tests are complicated by the antigenic differences between various strains of the causal agent.\n\n<b>Clinical presentation</b>\nFollowing an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks (range 3 to 21 days), a papule appears at the site of inoculation.\n - The papule progresses to an ulcer and then to eschar associated with fever and headache. <gdn-pref id='14501995'></gdn-pref>  \n - Eschars are most often found on the anterior chest and abdomen <gdn-pref id='17488895'></gdn-pref> but may occur on any part of the body. <gdn-pref id='21450057'></gdn-pref> <gdn-pref id='24737886'></gdn-pref>\n -
